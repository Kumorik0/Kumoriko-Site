                <p1>
                    I am Nephi (Kumoriko) Ryerson and I’m a music composer and producer creating primarily electronic, orchestral, and band styled tracks. I practice a wide variety of genres underneath these umbrella genres in order to hone my skills and one day be one of the best music creators. I aim to eventually inspire millions who hear my music in games or other media, or those who just like to listen to music. My non-musical hobbies include enjoying and dissecting video games and TV shows, making candy, and making resin dice. I’m a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day saints. I love my girlfriend.

                <h5 class="paragraph-2-title">Social links</h5>
                <p2>
                    As for exactly what social media I will have links for: an invite link to my Discord server, my Discord tag, my Instagram account, my TikTok account, my Twitter account, and links to where my music is released to (at least the most popular streaming services): Spotify, YouTube, iTunes, Apple Music, and if I get a SoundCloud Pro account, SoundCloud.

                <h5 class="paragraph-3-title">What is the purpose of this website?</h5>
                <p3>
                    This website is going to be the center for my musical profile and sharing of my music with the world. My fans would want to come to my website for contact information, social media links, or free downloads of my music. They may also want to use the site to easily share my music and social media themselves, as well. It’s a very convenient way to share everything relating to my music persona! For non-fans, sharing my portfolio of releases and letting them know how to contact me all in one place is a very professional way to go about networking. If I have someone I want to listen to my music and consider me for a job or gig, I can pretty much just send them a link to the website.
